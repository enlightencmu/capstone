          <p>Our generative research, January to May 2019,  consisted of literature review, competitive analysis, data-mining, structured interviews, and co-design sessions with data coordinators around the country. We aimed to identify data coordinators’ pain points, understand their data analysis process, and validate their needs for demographic comparison.</p>

          <p>Our project focuses on how we might leverage student growth data provided by Renaissance to generate insights about demographic comparison and enable educators to make data-driven educational decisions. We have formed our research questions as follows, and used them to guide our research phase:</p>
          <p><b>1. How do data coordinators communicate data to others and use data to inform educational decisions?</b></p>
          <p><b>2. How might we allow educators to process and gain insights from data more efficiently?</b></p>
          <p><b>3. How might demographic data comparison inform and influence educators’ decision-making process?</b></p>

          <p>We used a vast number of research methods to explore the problem space. These explorations provided us with insights on data coordinators' behaviors, decision-making, and pain points through comparing students' growth and performance among different demographics, and helped lay the foundation for our design.</p>
