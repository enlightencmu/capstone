              Our generative research, January to May 2019, consisted of
              literature review, competitive analysis, data-mining, structured
              interviews, and co-design sessions with data coordinators around
              the country. We aimed to identify data coordinators’ pain points,
              understand their data analysis process, and validate their needs
              for demographic comparison.

              We reviewed literature broadly related to our topic in order to

              analytics methodologies.

            <p>Our review resulted in the following 4 findings.</p>
            <p>
              <b

            <p>
              <b

                demographic features has more influences than selecting
                comparison methodology.</b

              During competitive analysis, we found NWEA, iReady, Istation are
              most similar in function to Renaissance’s Star, in that they all
              have educational software and dashboards for learning analytics.
              We also found that Renaissance may benefit from looking at certain
              products more closely, for example, FastBridge has great user
              interface, Ed-Data does well in the interactive dashboard, ISBE
              Ed360 and Future Ready PA are government website that present
              state tests performance with school level demographic information.
            </p>
            <p>
              Overall, these products vary in function and usability, but none
              of Renaissance’s major competitors provide demographic comparison
              as we define it. Future Ready PA from the State of Pennsylvania
              does provide excellent demographic comparison, but they base their
              scores on state test data. This creates an opportunity for
              Renaissance to provide more frequent data and create interventions
              before students take more high-stakes tests.

              After our main Findings were developed, we developed a Cultural
              Model to articulate our findings and better inform how data
              coordinators currently use data in their work-flow. More
              importantly, it reveals the value points, and motivations of
              different stakeholders. It helped us identify the breakdowns of
              the flow of information between different stakeholders, as well

              Our methods included card sorting and role-playing. Participants
              were asked to choose scenarios they are interested in, and then
              sort out cards with information they needed. With this
              information, they were prompted to describe or draw the visuals
              they wanted to use for communication. At last, they role-played
              with the interviewer to show how they would communicate the
              information with other educators in their school, using data as a
              reference.
