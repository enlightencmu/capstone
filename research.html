          <p>Text need update, this paragraph should be an overall brief of our research process. Our first round of research, January to May 2019,  consisted of literature review, competitive analysis, data-mining, structured interviews, and co-design sessions with data coordinators around the country. We aimed to identify data coordinators’ pain points, understand their data analysis process, and validate their needs for demographic comparison.</p>

          <p>Our project focuses on how we might leverage student growth data provided by Renaissance to generate insights about demographic comparison and enable educators to make data-driven educational decisions. We have formed our research questions as follows, and used them to guide our research phase:</p>
          <p><b>1. How do data coordinators communicate data to others and use data to inform educational decisions?</b></p>
          <p><b>2. How might we allow educators to process and gain insights from data more efficiently?</b></p>
          <p><b>3. How might demographic data comparison inform and influence educators’ decision-making process?</b></p>

          <p>Our first stage of quantitative data analysis focused on data-mining SS/NCE/SGP data in Star Reading/Math/Early Literacy from Renaissance with MDR data (school level demographic data). We aimed to find correlations between demographic data and growth using some basic statistical analysis and visualization, hoping to shed light on how demographic data could influence data coordinators’ decision-making process.</p>
          <p>We began with some linear regressions comparing growth scores against certain demographic variables, looking to confirm findings from Literature Review, such as how controllable and uncontrollable demographic aspects influence growth scores.</p>
          <p>The graph to the right confirms that as poverty percentage is negatively correlated with students’ score. This does not take into account that for different school levels (Elementary vs Middle vs High) there are different expectations for scores all plotted against the same 1400 scale.</p>
