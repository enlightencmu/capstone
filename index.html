          <p>Enlighten would like to thank Renaissance Learning for their support in this project. The Renaissance team has provided us with countless resources, valuable guidance, and excellent engagement from a host of internal personnel. We look forward to continuing our work with Renaissance, and maintaining our track record of a strong working relationship.</p>
          <p>We would especially like to thank Eric Stickney, David Butz, and Rob Andrews who have kept up constant communication, contributing direction and feedback throughout the course of the project. We are also highly grateful for Carol Dorn’s contributions, having done nearly all of our participant recruiting for us. Our work would not be possible without them. We would also like to thank our mentors, Ken Koedinger, Bruce McLaren and Timmy Burkhart, for giving us assistance with all aspects of our work.</p>

        <div class="section-content pure-u-1">
          <p>This is a placeholder. We will replace this paragraph with our summer final executive summary once we have it.</p>
          <p>As of now, data coordinators—the administrators most responsible for data processing to aid improvement—who use Renaissance Learning, Inc.’s Star 360 assessment package have access to a wealth of student growth data. They use data from Star to inform decision making and improve educational quality within a school or district. However, Renaissance has identified that data coordinators need to compare students’ achievement while taking their demographic contexts into account, an ability currently not available in Renaissance’s platform.To validate and address these needs, Renaissance Learning has partnered with Enlighten, a student consulting team from Carnegie Mellon University’s Masters in Education Technology and Applied Learning Science (METALS).</p>
          <p>Between January and May 2019, Enlighten has conducted our first round of research and found that data coordinators are interested in having access to comparison with similar schools mainly based on ethnicities, poverty level, special education, and school size. We also found that all eight of our interviewees would like to connect with similar schools to discuss decision making strategies that work in their context. A major component of our research involves mining Star assessment and demographic data to inform a model defining what it means for two schools to be “similar”, and to find correlations between demographic factors and growth. We have found that there are some demographic aspects that do correlate with score differences, such as percent of students with Free or Reduced Lunch (an indicator of poverty levels), and some do not, such as Teacher-to-Student Ratio. </p>
